# A Machine Learning-Based Sleep-Wake Analysis of Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease

## Introduction

Alzheimer’s Disease is an irreversible, neurodegenerative disorder. The molecular underpinnings of AD accumulate for decades before diagnoses are made, rendering treatments extremely difficult. Thus, improving current treatments requires a better understanding of the behavioral indicators of disease onset. The bi-directional relationship between sleep deficiency and disease progression allows for quantifying future disease risk. However, the conventional method of evaluating sleeping conditions requires extensive labor and has low timescale resolution. This work aims to build and evaluate the performance of ML models that learn from human experiences in sleep/wake scoring and analyze the sleep disorders trend in a mouse neurodegenerative disease model. We hypothesize that the predicted results support increased wakefulness in the ApoE4/tau mouse group, which correlates with age. Recordings of brain activity from 11 ApoE4/tau mice and 28 wild-type mice were used to train gradient-boosting trees and convolutional neural networks. Both models achieved an accuracy comparable to humans (≥ 85%). Statistical analysis of percentages of wakefulness in 24 hours supports that wakefulness is higher for TE4 mice since 200 days of age and has a positive polynomial correlation with age. A high level of wakefulness beyond a particular age point can predict the disease with high confidence. CNN models succeeded in upsampling the scoring labels to the milliseconds level and discovered transient neuropsychological events in wild-type animals that humans previously ignored. Future work involves investigating the presence of the new states in ApoE4/tau animals and their correlation with the disease.
